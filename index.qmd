## Project Overview

In the modern era of baseball analytics, few metrics are preached as loudly as the **First Pitch Strike (FPS)**. The philosophy is simple: get ahead **0-1**, and the batter is on the defensive. Fall behind **1-0**, and the pitcher is at the mercy of the hitter.

But does the data back up the dogma?

This project analyzes **Major League Baseball (2024 Season)** pitch-by-pitch data to determine exactly how the outcome of the very first pitch dictates the final result of the at-bat.

### The Core Question
We are not just looking at batting averages; we are looking at the **anatomy of the outcome**.
* *When a batter gets a Hit, did it usually start with a Ball or a Strike?*
* *When a batter walks, was the first pitch almost always a ball?*
* *How many Home Runs are surrendered after falling behind early?*

### Methodology
Using **R** and the **baseballr** package, I scraped and processed raw Statcast data to isolate the first pitch of every at-bat and track it to its final conclusion.
* **Data Source:** MLB Statcast (2024)
* **Tools:** R, Tidyverse, Quarto
* **Visualization:** Compositional Analysis (Pie Charts)

### How to Navigate
Use the **Analysis** dropdown menu at the top to explore specific outcomes:

* **FPS vs Hits:** Do hits come primarily from 1-0 counts?
* **FPS vs Walks:** How often does a first-pitch strike prevent a walk?
* **FPS vs Strikeouts:** The correlation between 0-1 starts and the K.
* **FPS vs Home Runs:** The cost of the first-pitch mistake.
